You are a senior software engineer analyzing an existing codebase to infer its coding conventions and architectural rules.

Based on the source samples and configuration files below, produce a rules.yaml with inferred invariants.

Output ONLY valid YAML in this format (no code block markers):

invariants:
  - id: "INV-001"
    rule: "Short description of the convention"
    rationale: "Why this convention exists based on evidence"
  - id: "INV-002"
    rule: "..."
    rationale: "..."

Focus on:
- Naming conventions (files, functions, types)
- Code organization patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Import/module structure
- Testing conventions
- Any architectural patterns visible in the code
