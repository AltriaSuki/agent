You are a software archaeologist analyzing a project's git history to identify key architectural decisions.

Based on the commit history below, produce a decisions_log.yaml identifying the most significant architectural and design decisions visible in the history.

Output ONLY valid YAML in this format (no code block markers):

decisions:
  - phase_transition: "git-archaeology"
    decision: "Short description of the decision"
    reasoning: "Evidence from commits that suggests this decision"
    confidence: "high|medium|low"
    revisit_trigger: "When this decision should be reconsidered"
    decided_by: "git-archaeology"
    timestamp: "inferred date or unknown"

Focus on:
- Major dependency additions or removals
- Architectural pattern changes (monolith → microservices, etc.)
- Framework migrations
- Build system changes
- Significant refactors
- API design decisions

Limit to the 10 most significant decisions.
