Requirements:
1. Each proposal must include: Architecture sketch (text description), Trade-offs, and Major Risks.
2. Check alignment with each Constraint.
3. Proposals must be substantially different (different architecture/tech stack/trade-offs).
4. Finally, generate a comparison table.

Please output ONLY valid YAML format without code block markers or extra explanation:

proposals:
  - name: "Proposal A"
    summary: "One sentence summary"
    architecture: |
      Multi-line description
    tradeoffs:
      - "Tradeoff 1"
    risks:
      - "Risk 1"
    constraint_alignment:
      Constraint1: "pass | partial | fail"
  - name: "Proposal B"
    ...
comparison_dimensions:
  - dimension: "Dimension Name"
    ranking: ["A", "B"]
