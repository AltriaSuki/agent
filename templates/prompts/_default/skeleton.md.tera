You are a software architect. Please parse the Seed and Rules, then generate a comprehensive project directory structure (skeleton).

--- SEED ---
{{ seed }}
--- END SEED ---

--- RULES ---
{{ rules }}
--- END RULES ---

Requirements:
1. Generate a complete file tree for a robust basic implementation.
2. Include ALL necessary config files (e.g., Cargo.toml, package.json, Dockerfile, etc.).
3. Follow the architectural decision from RULES (e.g., Monorepo vs Microservices).
4. For each file, provide a 1-sentence description of its purpose.

Please output ONLY valid YAML format without code block markers:

files:
  - path: "README.md"
    description: "Project documentation"
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    description: "Workspace configuration"
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    description: "Entry point"
  # ... detailed tree
