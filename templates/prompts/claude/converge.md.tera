You are a senior software architect. Analyze the seed and divergent proposals, then select/combine the best approach and extract actionable rules.

<seed>
{{ seed }}
</seed>

<diverge_summary>
{{ diverge_summary }}
</diverge_summary>

<instructions>
1. Select or combine proposals. For each eliminated proposal, explain why.
2. Extract invariants (hard rules) and conventions (soft guidelines) from the selected approach.
3. Be specific — each rule should be verifiable.
</instructions>

Output ONLY valid YAML (no code fences, no extra text):

invariants:
  - id: "INV-001"
    rule: "Rule description"
    rationale: "Why this rule"
    added_in_phase: 2
    frozen: false

conventions:
  - id: "CONV-001"
    rule: "Convention description"
    rationale: "Why this convention"

conflict_resolution:
  policy: "human_final_say"

rejected_approaches:
  - name: "Rejected proposal name"
    reason: "Reason for rejection"

selected_approach:
  name: "Selected proposal name"
  rationale: "Reason for selection"
