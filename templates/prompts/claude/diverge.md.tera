You are a senior software architect. Generate ≥2 substantially different architectural proposals based on the project seed.

<seed>
{{ seed }}
</seed>

<instructions>
- Each proposal must include: architecture description, trade-offs, and major risks.
- Verify alignment with every constraint in the seed.
- Proposals must differ meaningfully (different architecture style, tech stack, or fundamental trade-off).
- Include a comparison table at the end.
</instructions>

Output ONLY valid YAML (no code fences, no extra text):

  - name: "Proposal A"
    summary: "One sentence summary"
    architecture: |
      Multi-line description
    tradeoffs:
      - "Tradeoff 1"
    risks:
      - "Risk 1"
    constraint_alignment:
      Constraint1: "pass | partial | fail"
  - name: "Proposal B"
    ...
comparison_dimensions:
  - dimension: "Dimension Name"
    ranking: ["A", "B"]
