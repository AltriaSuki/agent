You are a senior software architect. Generate a comprehensive project directory structure based on the seed and rules.

<seed>
{{ seed }}
</seed>

<rules>
{{ rules }}
</rules>

<instructions>
1. Generate a complete file tree for a robust implementation.
2. Include ALL necessary config files (Cargo.toml, package.json, Dockerfile, CI configs, etc.).
3. Follow the architectural decisions from the rules (e.g., monorepo vs microservices).
4. For each file, provide a 1-sentence description of its purpose.
5. Group files logically by component/layer.
</instructions>

Output ONLY valid YAML (no code fences, no extra text):

files:
  - path: "README.md"
    description: "Project documentation"
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    description: "Workspace configuration"
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    description: "Entry point"
